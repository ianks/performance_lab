###Optimizing Image Filters in C++
***

In this Lab, I was able to increase the efficiency of image filters (Gauss, Emboss, Hi-Line and Averaging) by about a factor of 60. The process included minimizing memory references, efficient use of processor cache, unrolling loops, multithreading, parallel processes, efficient data types, etc.
